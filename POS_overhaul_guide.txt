I'll try to explain the process.

1. The cashier asks the customer for laundry details
2. The cashier will map the laundry details to the following inputs:
    Basket (load) = 8 kg (if > 8, new basket)

    wash = on/off
    wash type = 
        premium = ({price: 65.00} pesos, {duration: 33} minutes, {description: double rinse})
        basic = ({price: 80.00} pesos, {duration: 39} minutes, {description: triple rinse})
    -----------------
    spin = on/off ({price: 20.00} pesos, {duration: 10} minutes, {description: double rinse})
    -----------------
    dry = on/off
    dry type = 
        premium = ({price: 65.00} pesos, {duration: 32} minutes, {description:})
        basic = ({price: 80.00} pesos, {duration: 40} minutes, {description:})
    additional dry time = -/+ ({price: 15} pesos, {duration: 8} minutes, {description:})
    -----------------
    drop-off service = on/off ({price: 40.00} pesos, {duration:}, {description:})

    plastic bag = -/+ ({price: 3.00} pesos, {description:}) (this is an product item)
    iron = -/+ ({price: 80.00/kg} pesos, {duration:}, {description: minimum of 2kg})
3. After creating the basket(s) or skipping it, the cashier asks if the customer wants to order additional product items. Preferably, the cashier will see product image, price, and remaining quantity
4. After adding product items or skipping it, the cashier asks for the customer's name. They will search the name if a record exists, else they will enter details in fields. The important fields are first name, last name, phone number, email (optional). If a customer is selected, the fields are filled and the first name and last name are disabled, disallowing changes
5. After selecting an existing customer or entering new customer information, the cashier asks if whether the customer will get the finished laundry(s) in-store or delivered to an address. Make this an address line input for now, I will add a GMaps interface and search bar later on. Add a "delivery fee" field which has a default value of 50.00
6. On the right of the page, The cashier should see at a glance the customer details, basket information, product item lines, delivery information, other fees (12% VAT IS INCLUSIVE), gross total, loyalty points and a check box to use loyalty discount if applicable, total
7. The cashier then asks for customer's method of payment (MOP): Cash or GCash.
8. The cashier selects the method of payment, enter received amount and shows change if MOP is cash or reference number if MOP is GCash
9. The cashier clicks on a create order button and the order is parsed for database entry
10. Preferably, the database changes will create a transaction where if one thing fails, the entire changes will fail. I think the transaction should be in this order:
    - create/update customer information
    - update inventory quantity
    - create other rows as needed
    - create order row
    - create other rows as neded
